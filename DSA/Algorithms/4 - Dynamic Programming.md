# **Dynamic Programming in C++**

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful optimization technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is particularly useful for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties.

## **1. Introduction to Dynamic Programming**

### **1.1. Characteristics of Dynamic Programming**
- **Overlapping Subproblems**: Problems can be broken down into smaller, overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.
- **Optimal Substructure**: An optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.

### **1.2. When to Use Dynamic Programming**
Use DP when:
- The problem can be divided into smaller subproblems.
- The same subproblems are solved multiple times.

## **2. Steps to Solve a Dynamic Programming Problem**

1. **Characterize the Structure of an Optimal Solution**: Define how the solution can be constructed from the solutions of subproblems.
  
2. **Define the Recursion**: Write a recursive formula for the solution. This will often involve defining a function that takes parameters related to the problem's state.

3. **Compute the Value of the Optimal Solution**: This can be done either using a top-down (memoization) or bottom-up (tabulation) approach.

4. **Construct the Optimal Solution** (if required): Trace back through the computed values to find the actual solution.

## **3. Common Dynamic Programming Problems**

### **3.1. Fibonacci Sequence**
#### **Problem Statement**
Find the n-th Fibonacci number.

#### **Dynamic Programming Approach**
Use memoization to store previously computed Fibonacci numbers.

#### **Implementation**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int fibMemoization(int n, vector<int>& memo) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    if (memo[n] != -1) return memo[n];

    memo[n] = fibMemoization(n - 1, memo) + fibMemoization(n - 2, memo);
    return memo[n];
}

int fibonacci(int n) {
    vector<int> memo(n + 1, -1); // Initialize memoization array
    return fibMemoization(n, memo);
}

int main() {
    int n = 10;
    cout << "Fibonacci of " << n << " is: " << fibonacci(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### **3.2. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**
#### **Problem Statement**
Given two sequences, find the length of the longest subsequence present in both of them.

#### **Dynamic Programming Approach**
Build a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` stores the length of LCS of the first `i` characters of the first string and the first `j` characters of the second string.

#### **Implementation**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int longestCommonSubsequence(string a, string b) {
    int m = a.length();
    int n = b.length();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1; // Characters match
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]); // Characters do not match
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[m][n];
}

int main() {
    string a = "AGGTAB";
    string b = "GXTXAYB";
    cout << "Length of LCS is: " << longestCommonSubsequence(a, b) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### **3.3. 0/1 Knapsack Problem**
#### **Problem Statement**
Given weights and values of items, determine the maximum value that can be accommodated in a knapsack of a given capacity.

#### **Dynamic Programming Approach**
Use a 2D DP table where `dp[i][w]` represents the maximum value that can be obtained with the first `i` items and weight limit `w`.

#### **Implementation**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int knapsack(int capacity, vector<int>& weights, vector<int>& values, int n) {
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(capacity + 1, 0));

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int w = 1; w <= capacity; w++) {
            if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i - 1][w], dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]] + values[i - 1]);
            } else {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n][capacity];
}

int main() {
    int capacity = 50;
    vector<int> weights = {10, 20, 30};
    vector<int> values = {60, 100, 120};
    int n = weights.size();

    cout << "Maximum value in Knapsack: " << knapsack(capacity, weights, values, n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### **3.4. Minimum Edit Distance**
#### **Problem Statement**
Given two strings, find the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, substitutions) required to transform one string into another.

#### **Dynamic Programming Approach**
Use a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum edit distance between the first `i` characters of one string and the first `j` characters of the other.

#### **Implementation**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int minEditDistance(string a, string b) {
    int m = a.length();
    int n = b.length();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1));

    for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            if (i == 0) {
                dp[i][j] = j; // If first string is empty
            } else if (j == 0) {
                dp[i][j] = i; // If second string is empty
            } else if (a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]; // Characters match
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = 1 + min({dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]}); // Min of insert, delete, substitute
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[m][n];
}

int main() {
    string a = "sunday";
    string b = "saturday";
    cout << "Minimum Edit Distance: " << minEditDistance(a, b) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
