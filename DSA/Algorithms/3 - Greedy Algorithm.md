# **Greedy Algorithms in C++**

Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that make a series of choices, each of which looks best at the moment. They work by choosing the local optimum in hopes that these local optima will lead to a global optimum. This guide covers the fundamental concepts of greedy algorithms, their applications, and some common problems solved using this approach.

## **1. Introduction to Greedy Algorithms**

### **1.1. Characteristics of Greedy Algorithms**
- **Local Optimal Choice**: Greedy algorithms make a choice that seems best at the moment without considering future consequences.
- **Irrevocability**: Once a choice is made, it cannot be undone.
- **Feasibility**: The chosen option must be feasible, meaning it must satisfy the problem's constraints.

### **1.2. When to Use Greedy Algorithms**
Greedy algorithms are particularly useful when:
- The problem exhibits the **greedy-choice property**: A global optimum can be reached by selecting a local optimum.
- The problem has **optimal substructure**: An optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to subproblems.

## **2. Common Greedy Algorithm Problems**

### **2.1. Coin Change Problem**
#### **Problem Statement**
Given a set of denominations and a total amount, determine the minimum number of coins needed to make that amount.

#### **Greedy Approach**
Always choose the largest denomination first until you reach the desired total.

#### **Implementation**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
    int count = 0;
    // Sort coins in descending order
    sort(coins.begin(), coins.end(), greater<int>());

    for (int coin : coins) {
        while (amount >= coin) {
            amount -= coin;
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> coins = {1, 5, 10, 25}; // Coin denominations
    int amount = 63; // Total amount
    int result = coinChange(coins, amount);

    cout << "Minimum coins needed: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### **2.2. Activity Selection Problem**
#### **Problem Statement**
Given a set of activities with start and end times, select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person.

#### **Greedy Approach**
Select the activity that finishes first and proceed to the next activity that starts after the selected activity ends.

#### **Implementation**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct Activity {
    int start;
    int finish;
};

bool activityComparator(Activity a, Activity b) {
    return a.finish < b.finish; // Sort based on finish time
}

int activitySelection(vector<Activity>& activities) {
    sort(activities.begin(), activities.end(), activityComparator);
    int count = 1; // Always select the first activity
    int lastFinishTime = activities[0].finish;

    for (int i = 1; i < activities.size(); i++) {
        if (activities[i].start >= lastFinishTime) {
            count++;
            lastFinishTime = activities[i].finish;
        }
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    vector<Activity> activities = {{1, 3}, {2, 5}, {4, 6}, {5, 7}, {7, 8}};
    int result = activitySelection(activities);

    cout << "Maximum number of activities: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### **2.3. Huffman Coding**
#### **Problem Statement**
Given a set of characters and their frequencies, build a binary tree that minimizes the total weighted path length from the root.

#### **Greedy Approach**
Use a priority queue to repeatedly combine the two least frequent nodes until only one node remains.

#### **Implementation**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    char character;
    int frequency;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node(char c, int f) : character(c), frequency(f), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

// Comparator for the priority queue
struct Compare {
    bool operator()(Node* a, Node* b) {
        return a->frequency > b->frequency; // Min-heap
    }
};

void huffmanCoding(string characters, vector<int> frequencies) {
    priority_queue<Node*, vector<Node*>, Compare> minHeap;

    // Create leaf nodes and add them to the priority queue
    for (size_t i = 0; i < characters.size(); i++) {
        minHeap.push(new Node(characters[i], frequencies[i]));
    }

    // Combine nodes until only one remains
    while (minHeap.size() > 1) {
        Node* left = minHeap.top();
        minHeap.pop();
        Node* right = minHeap.top();
        minHeap.pop();

        Node* merged = new Node('\0', left->frequency + right->frequency);
        merged->left = left;
        merged->right = right;

        minHeap.push(merged);
    }

    // The final node is the root of the Huffman tree
    Node* root = minHeap.top();

    // Print the Huffman codes (not implemented in this example)
}

int main() {
    string characters = "abcdef";
    vector<int> frequencies = {5, 9, 12, 13, 16, 45};

    huffmanCoding(characters, frequencies);
    cout << "Huffman coding has been built." << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
