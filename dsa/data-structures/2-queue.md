# **Guide to Queue in C++ DSA**

## **1. Introduction to Queue**
A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First In First Out (FIFO)** principle, meaning the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. It can be visualized as a line of people waiting for service; the person who arrived first is served first.

### **Basic Properties**
- **Enqueue:** Add an element to the rear of the queue.
- **Dequeue:** Remove an element from the front of the queue.
- **Front:** Retrieve the front element without removing it.
- **Rear:** Retrieve the rear element without removing it.
- **isEmpty:** Check if the queue is empty.
- **Size:** Get the number of elements in the queue.

## **2. Queue Operations**
The primary operations for a queue include:

| Operation   | Description                           |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| **enqueue(x)**  | Adds element `x` to the rear of the queue. |
| **dequeue()**   | Removes the front element of the queue.     |
| **front()**     | Returns the front element without removing it. |
| **rear()**      | Returns the rear element without removing it.  |
| **isEmpty()**   | Returns true if the queue is empty, else false. |
| **size()**      | Returns the number of elements in the queue.   |

## **3. Queue Implementation in C++**

### **Using an Array**
Hereâ€™s how you can implement a queue using a fixed-size array:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define MAX 100

class Queue {
private:
    int arr[MAX];
    int front, rear;

public:
    Queue() {
        front = -1; // Initialize front to -1
        rear = -1;  // Initialize rear to -1
    }

    // Enqueue operation
    void enqueue(int x) {
        if (rear >= MAX - 1) {
            cout << "Queue Overflow!" << endl;
            return;
        }
        if (front == -1) front = 0; // Set front to 0 on the first enqueue
        arr[++rear] = x; // Increment rear and insert the element
    }

    // Dequeue operation
    int dequeue() {
        if (front == -1 || front > rear) {
            cout << "Queue Underflow!" << endl;
            return -1; // Return an invalid value
        }
        return arr[front++]; // Return the front element and increment front
    }

    // Front operation
    int frontElement() {
        if (front == -1 || front > rear) {
            cout << "Queue is empty!" << endl;
            return -1; // Return an invalid value
        }
        return arr[front]; // Return the front element
    }

    // Rear operation
    int rearElement() {
        if (rear == -1) {
            cout << "Queue is empty!" << endl;
            return -1; // Return an invalid value
        }
        return arr[rear]; // Return the rear element
    }

    // Check if queue is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        return (front == -1 || front > rear);
    }

    // Get the size of the queue
    int size() {
        if (front == -1) return 0; // Queue is empty
        return (rear - front + 1);
    }
};

int main() {
    Queue q;

    q.enqueue(10);
    q.enqueue(20);
    q.enqueue(30);

    cout << "Front element is: " << q.frontElement() << endl; // Output: 10
    cout << "Queue size is: " << q.size() << endl; // Output: 3

    cout << "Dequeued element is: " << q.dequeue() << endl; // Output: 10
    cout << "New front element is: " << q.frontElement() << endl; // Output: 20

    return 0;
}
```

### **Using STL (Standard Template Library)**
C++ provides a built-in queue container in the STL, which can be used as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue> // Include the queue header
using namespace std;

int main() {
    queue<int> q;

    // Enqueue elements
    q.push(10);
    q.push(20);
    q.push(30);

    cout << "Front element is: " << q.front() << endl; // Output: 10
    cout << "Queue size is: " << q.size() << endl; // Output: 3

    cout << "Dequeued element is: " << q.front() << endl; // Output: 10
    q.pop();

    cout << "New front element is: " << q.front() << endl; // Output: 20

    return 0;
}
```

## **4. Applications of Queue**
Queues have numerous applications, including:

1. **Order Processing:** Queues are used in order processing systems where orders are handled in the order they arrive.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** BFS uses a queue to traverse nodes in a graph.
3. **CPU Scheduling:** Queues manage the execution order of processes in operating systems.
4. **Print Queue:** Print jobs are managed in the order they are received.
5. **Buffer Management:** Queues can be used for buffering data streams, such as in IO operations.

## **5. Complexity Analysis**
The time complexity for the primary queue operations is as follows:
- **Enqueue:** O(1)
- **Dequeue:** O(1)
- **Front:** O(1)
- **Rear:** O(1)
- **isEmpty:** O(1)
- **Size:** O(1)

## **6. Conclusion**
Understanding queues is essential for mastering more complex data structures and algorithms. They are widely used in various applications, making them a fundamental concept in computer science.
